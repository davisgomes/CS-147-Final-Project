## Design and Implementation
For this project we have implemented a dart game. 
The player is competing against a computer opponent, and their goal is to achieve a higher score.
For scoring, we have implemented collision detection that uses collision boundaries to calculate the darts position and resulting score.
The darts travel is based on an initial velocity that the user can edit with the power feature.
The dart's flight physics are modeled by a gravitational force that causes an arching motion for a more realistic dart simulation.
The dart sways back and forth to allow the users to aim their dart in any direction of the board.
Using our score displaying method, the score is updated based on the detected collision section.
With all these features, we have created an entertaining and realistic dart game.

## Advanced Features
As mentioned in the design and implementation section, this project relies on collision detection to calculate the score.
Additionally, we have implemented flight physics to achieve an accurate and realistic flight to the dart.

## Setup
This project uses the default tiny-graphics setup and can be run similarly to the assignments.
